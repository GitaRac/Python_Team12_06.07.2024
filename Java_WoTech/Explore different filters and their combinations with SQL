To explore different filters and their combinations using SQL with the provided pet clinic data files, we need to first understand the structure of these files. I will load and inspect the contents of each file to identify the available fields (columns) and then suggest possible filters that can be applied.

I'll start by reading and displaying a few rows from each of the files: Owners.csv, Pets.csv, Procedures.csv, and Sales.csv.

Summary of Data Files:

1. Owners.csv:

Columns: OwnerID, Name, Surname, StreetAddress, City, State, StateFull, ZipCode
Sample Filters:
Filter by city or state (e.g., all owners in Michigan).
Filter by owner's name or surname.
Filter by zip code.

2. Pets.csv:

Columns: PetID, Name, Kind, Sex, Age, OwnerID
Sample Filters:
Filter by pet kind (e.g., all dogs or cats).
Filter by pet's age (e.g., pets older than 5 years).
Filter by pet's sex (e.g., all male pets).
Filter by specific owner (using OwnerID).

3. Procedures.csv:

Columns: ProcedureCode, ProcedureType, ProcedureSubCode, Description, Price
Sample Filters:
Filter by procedure type (e.g., grooming, vaccinations).
Filter by price range (e.g., procedures costing more than $50).
Filter by specific procedure description.

4. Sales.csv:

Columns: TransactionID, Country, PetID, Date, ProcedureCode
Sample Filters:
Filter by country.
Filter by date (e.g., transactions within a certain year).
Filter by specific procedure (using ProcedureCode).
Filter by specific pet (using PetID).

5. Potential SQL Filters and Combinations:

Combining Filters Across Tables:
Filter pets by their kind and list all corresponding procedures.
Filter transactions by date and list all pets and owners involved.
Filter procedures by type and list all associated sales and pets.

EXAMPLES:

You can find Uniqe Pet kinds. And there are birds in the Database.
SELECT DISTINCT Kind FROM Pets

The number of owners
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Owners;

Get the top 5 owners with the most pets: 
SELECT o.Name, COUNT(p.PetID) AS PetCount FROM Owners o JOIN Pets p ON o.OwnerID = p.OwnerID GROUP BY o.Name ORDER BY PetCount DESC LIMIT 5;

Top 5 most expensive procedures 
SELECT Description, Price
FROM Procedures
ORDER BY Price DESC
LIMIT 5;

Find Male Birds that are between 1  and 3 years old 
SELECT * FROM Pets WHERE Sex = 'male'AND Kind = 'Bird' AND Age BETWEEN 1 AND 3;
